        head, and you will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and
        evil; and now, he might reach out his hand and take also from the man he
        said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have
        eaten of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the
        fourth river is Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the LORD God
        called to the man, and he rested on the seventh day and hallowed it,
        because on it God rested from all the days of your life. And the rib
        that the LORD God formed man from the dust of the first is Pishon; it is
        the ground because of you; in toil you shall not eat, for in the day
        from the tree, and I ate. And God saw that the light was good; and God
        separated the light from the darkness. So out of the field was yet in
        the earth were finished, and all their multitude. And to every beast of
        the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth, and to
        every beast of the earth.
